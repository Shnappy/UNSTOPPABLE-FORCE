# UNSTOPPABLE FORCE

Welcome to Unstoppable Force repo, the project is planned to be finished by the end of 2024, however it's currently put on hold. Currently tha game features a fully functional player with a few advanced movement mechanics, one enemy with AI implemented and one map to play around with.

At its current state, the project presents itself as a nice skeleton of a future game, but doesn't have much going for it right now.
